A Note About the Branches
=========================
There are 2 branches in this public repository for CNModel.

The "master" branch is the original branch that goes with Manis and Campagnola, Hear. Res. 2018. This is a Python 2.7 branch.

The "python3" branch is new (June, 2019). It has been tested with Python 3.6 and 3.7.3. Please read the notes on that branch for information on differences and new functionality.


About CNModel
=============

CNModel is a Python-based interface to NEURON models of cochlear nucleus neurons, synapses, network connectivity. To drive the model with sound stimuli, the Zilany et al (2010, 2014) auditory periphery model is used to generate auditory nerve spike trains (either via the "cochlea" Python package or by the original MATLAB model; see below). The overall goal is to provide a platform for modeling networks of cochlear nucleus neurons with different levels of biological realism in the context of an accurate simulation of auditory nerve input.

At the lowest level are NEURON-based implementations of ion channels and synapses. Ion channel models for potassium channels are derived largely from the measurements and models of Rothman and Manis (2003abc), and Kanold and Manis (1999, 2001); other channels are derived or modified from the literature. Cell models are in turn based on the insertion of ion channels in densities based on measurements in guinea pig and mouse. The "point" somatic cell models, which form the base set of models in CNModel, replicate the data reported in the original papers. 

The postsynaptic receptor/conductance models are based on kinetic models of glutamate (Raman and Trussell, 1992) and glycinergic receptors, as adjusted to match measurements of synaptic conductances from the mouse cochlear nucleus collected in Xie and Manis, 2013. The glutamate receptor models include desensitization and the effects of internal polyamine receptor block, based on the kinetic scheme of Woodhull (1982).

The presynaptic release model includes a multisite, probabilistic synapse that includes time-dependent changes in release probability based on the Dittman, Kreitzer and Regehr (J Neurosci. 2000 Feb 15;20(4):1374-85) kinetic scheme. Although detailed, this model is computationally expensive and likely not suitable for large scale network simulations. Other simpler models of synapses are also included.

Network connectivity may be defined programmatically, or based on a table of connectivity patterns. A table with estimates derived from the literature is included in the source. 

Included in this package is a set of test suites for different components. An overriding set of unit tests is available to confirm performance of the base models against a set of reference runs, several of which are in turn directly traceable to the original manuscripts. The test suites are useful in verifying performance of the model after modifications of the code or changes in the installation (upgrades of Python or Matlab, for example).

Installation requirements
-------------------------
This package depends on the following:

1. Python 2.7 with numpy (1.11), scipy (0.19.0), lmfit (0.9.6), matplotlib (2.0 or 1.5), faulthandler, and pyqtgraph (0.9.10). The cochlea module requires pandas as well. 
   An Anaconda install with the appropriate scientific packages works well::
       
       conda install python=2.7 pyqt pyqtgraph matplotlib numpy scipy pandas pytest faulthandler
       
2. lmfit (nonlinear fitter) is best obtained via pip to install the latest versions: ``pip install lmfit``
3. A Python-linked version of NEURON (www.neuron.yale.edu). The code has been tested with NEURON 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5.
4. A C compiler (gcc). Needed for compilation of mechanisms for NEURON.
5. The Zilany et al (JASA 2014) auditory periphery model. This can be provided one of two ways:
    
   * The Python-based cochlea model by Rudnicki and Hemmert at https://github.com/mrkrd/cochlea. 
     This is probably best installed via pip per the instructions on the PyPi site: ``pip install cochlea``.
   * The original MATLAB-based Zilany model; requires MATLAB 2011 or later. A C compiler will also
     be needed to build this model. The model should be placed in the directory 
     ``cnmodel/cnmodel/an_model/model``, with the following components: ANmodel.m, complex.c, complex.h, 
     complex.hpp, ffGn.m, fituaudiogram2.m, mexANmodel.m, model_IHC.c, model_Synapse.c, 
     and the THRESHOLD_ALL_* files. When cnmodel attempts to access this code the first time, 
     it will perform the necessary compilation.
   
6. neuronvis (optional) available at https://github.com/campagnola/neuronvis or https://github.com/pbmanis/neuronvis).
   This provides 3D visualization for morphology.

For more detailed information on setup in a Windows environment, see the file Windows_setup.md. Thanks to Laurel Carney for prompting the generation of this set of instructions, and for identifying issues on Windows.

Note: *This package is not yet compatible with Python 3.x. Neuron is not yet compatible with Python 3.x*

Testing
-------

After the code is installed, enter the cnmodel directory and compile the NEURON mod files::

    $ nrnivmodl cnmodel/mechanisms

This will create a directory ("x86_64" or "special") in the top cnmodel directory with the compiled mechanisms.

At that point::

    $ python examples/toy_model.py
     
should generate a plot with several sets of traces showing responses of individual neuron models to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current steps.

The test suite should be run as:

    $ python test.py

This will test each of the models against reference data, the synapse mechanisms, a number of internal routines, and the auditory nerve model. The tests should pass for each component. Failures may indicate incorrect installation or incorrect function within individual components. These should be corrected before proceeding with simulations.


Figures
-------

The data for the figures in the manuscript (Manis and Campagnola, Hearing Research 2018) can be generated using the bash script "figures.sh" in the examples subdirectory. 
From the main cnmodel directory::

    $ ./examples figures.sh fignum

where fignum is one of 2a, 2b, 2c, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b, or 7.

Note that Figure 7 may take several **hours** to generate.

Example code and tests

  Supported cell types: sgc, bushy, tstellate, dstellate
- `toy_model.py` generates IV plots for each of the principal point cell types included in CNModel. This is the code that generates Figure 3 of the manuscript.

Potential Issues and Solutions
------------------------------

1.  Occasionally one of the AN spike train files, which are stored in the directory `cnmodel/an_model/cache`, become locked. This can occur if the calling routines are aborted (^C, ^Z) in the middle of a transaction accessing the cache file, or perhaps during when parallel processing is enabled and a routine fails or is aborted. In this case, a file with the extension ``".lock"`` exists, which prevents the an_model code from accessing the file. The ``".lock"`` file needs to be deleted from the cache directory.
    
  *  First, print a list of the locked files::
  
      $ find /path/to/cache -name '*.lock'
    
  * Where /path/to/cache may be something like `cnmodel/an_model/cache`. 
    There is most likely only one such file in the diretory.

  * Next, to delete the files::
  
      $ find /path/to/cache -name '*.lock' -delete
       
  * Under Windows (and other OS's), you should be able do accomplish the same thing
    with the File Explorer/Finder, limiting the files by extension.
